1.  Introduction

   This document proposes a control bit in IPv6 RA PIO message called
   the X bit, that indicates that the host receiving this RA is the only
   host in the prefix.  The host then can stop using ND and DAD for
   addresses within this prefix.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Description

   There are several initiatives that propose network side practices
   that provides customer isolation and to enhance scalability, power
   efficiency, security and other factors in networks.  Some of these
   involve isolating a host so that the host is the only one in the L3
   subnet (prefix).

   (list drafts/RFCs here)

   This document proposes an additional bit in the IPv6 Prefix
   Information Option (PIO) that tells the host that it's the only host

   in this prefix, and that it thus doesn't need to perform ND
   (Neighbour Discovery) and DAD (Duplicate Address Detection)

2.1.  Terminology

   RA-X unicast Router Advertisement packet containing a PIO (Prefix
   Information Option) with the X bit set

2.1.1.  term a

2.1.2.  term b

2.1.3.  term c

   R3


2.1.4.  term d

3.  Router behaviour

3.1.  foo

   When the host starts using the network connection it sends out an RS
   (Router Solicitation).  This is one way of detecting that a new
   device.  If the router is configured to use RA-X, it can now prepare
   itself to send the RA-X and then send it.

   The RA-X packet MUST be sent using the unicast L2 address (if
   applicable) and the L3 address of the host, learnt from the RS packet
   received from the host.

   (***HOW TO HANDLE WHEN FOR INSTANCE 802.1X OR WIFI-AP-ATTACHMENT IS
   USED TO DETECT A NEW HOST***)

3.2.  Preparations before sending RA-X

   When the router intends to send the RA-X, it MUST before sending the
   RA packet install an IPv6 forwarding entry, assuring the prefix works
   as soon as the host receives the RA-X and starts using it.

3.3.  Timers

   The router MUST send new unicast RAs according to the times defined
   in RFC XXX section XYZ.  It detects that the host is still available
   either by wiki AP attachment, link being up, or by verifying host
   availability by doing NUD (????).

3.4.  Host behaviour

   When the host receives an RA-X the host knows that it is alone and in
   full control of the prefix, the A (Autonomous) bit is implied to be
   set and the host can choose any valid addresses it wants within the
   subnet.
