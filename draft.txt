   IPv6 Router Advertisement Prefix Information Option Exclusive Bit
                draft-kline-6man-pio-exclusive-bit-pre00

Abstract

   This document defines a new control bit in the IPv6 RA PIO flags
   octet that indicates that the node receiving this RA is the exclusive
   receiver of all traffic destined to any address with that prefix.

   Termed the eXclusive bit (or "X bit"), nodes that recognize this can
   perform some traffic-saving optimizations (e.g. disable ND and DAD
   for addresses within this prefix) and more easily make creative use
   of its address space (vis a vis 7934 or even 64share).

   Use of the X bit is backward compatible with existing compliant
   implementations.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a new control bit in the Internet Protocol
   version 6 (IPv6) Router Advertisement (RA) Prefix Information Option
   (PIO) flags octet that indicates that the node receiving this RA is
   the exclusive receiver of all traffic destined to any address with
   that prefix.  Subject to the lifetime constraints within the PIO, the
   receiving node effectively has exclusive use of the prefix, and will

Internet-Draft   Prefix Information Option Exclusive Bit     August 2016


   be the next hop destination for the sending router, and possibly
   other routers, for all traffic destined toward the prefix.

   Termed the eXclusive bit (or "X bit"), nodes that recognize this can
   perform some traffic-saving optimizations (e.g. disable Neighbor
   Discovery (ND) and Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) for addresses
   within this prefix) and more easily make creative use of its address
   space (vis a vis 7934).

   Use of the X bit is backward compatible with existing compliant
   implementations.  RFC 4861 compliant nodes that do not understand the
   X bit are not negatively impacted.  They must ignore it, and can
   process the PIO under existing standards, making use of the
   information exactly as if the X bit were not set.

2.  Motivation

   There are several initiatives that propose network side practices
   that provide customer isolation and to enhance scalability, power
   efficiency, security and other factors in networks.  Some of these
   involve isolating a host so that the host is the only one in the L3
   subnet (prefix).

   (list drafts/RFCs here)

   This document proposes an additional bit in the IPv6 Prefix
   Information Option (PIO) that tells the host that it's the only host
   in this prefix, and that it thus doesn't need to perform ND
   (Neighbour Discovery) and DAD (Duplicate Address Detection)

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   Throughout this document the following terminology is used purely for
   the sake of brevity.

2.2.1.  PIO-X

   The term "PIO-X" is used to refer to a Prefix Information Option
   (PIO) that has the X bit set.

2.2.2.  PIO-X RA

   The phrase "PIO-X RA" is used to refer to an RA that contains one or
   more PIO-X entries (the same RA may also contain one or more PIOs
   without the X bit set).

2.2.3.  Host

   The term "host" may be used interchangably throughout this document
   to mean a node receiving an RA.  No behaviour restrictions
   traditionally associated with distinctions between host and router
   are placed on nodes receiving any PIO-X RA.

3.  Updated Prefix Information Option

   This document updates the Prefix Information Option specification in
   RFC 4861, section 4.6.2 with the specification of new bit from the
   former Reserved1 field as follows.

3.1.  Updated format description

   Fields:

    X      The eXclusive ownership indicator flag, defined by this
           document. When set, the receiving node can be assured that
           all traffic destined to any address within the specified
           Prefix will forwarded to itself by, at a minimum, the router
           from which the encapsulating RA was received, but possibly
           other routers as well.  When not set, the receiving node MUST
           NOT make any assumptions of exclusive use of the specified
           Prefix, i.e. processing is unchanged from previous standards

    fields

3.2.  Processing

   Nodes compliant with this specification, i.e. those that understand
   the X bit, MUST ignore the actual values of the L and A bits and
   instead intepret them as follows:

   o  interpret the L bit as if it were 0 (L=0)

Internet-Draft   Prefix Information Option Exclusive Bit     August 2016


   o  interpret the A bit as it it were 1 (A=1)

   The rationale for this is discussed further in Section 4.

   It is RECOMMENDED that RAs containing a PIO with the X bit set also
   explicitly configure the PIO flags L=0 and A=1, for backward
   compatibility (use by non X-bit aware nodes).

4.  Host behaviour

4.1.  PIO-X processing

   A receiving node compliant with this document processes a PIO entry
   with the X bit set following the requirements in previous standards
   documents (chiefly rfc4861#section-6.3.4) with one key difference:
   the actual values of the L bit and the A bit are ignored.  Instead,
   the receiving node MUST interpret the L and A bits according to
   Section 3.2.

4.1.1.  L bit

   Because a PIO-X aware node will know that it has exclusive use of a
   prefix with non-zero valid lifetime, the prefix itself cannot be
   considered to be on-link with respect to the link on which the PIO-X
   RA was received.

   Note that a given address from within the prefix may be considered
   on-link according to the definition in rfc5942#section-4, item 1,
   should the receiving node chose to configure that address on said
   link, but this is in no way synonymous with the entire prefix being
   considered on-link.

4.1.2.  A bit

   Because a PIO-X aware node will know that it has exclusive use of a
   prefix with non-zero valid lifetime, autoconfiguration of addresses
   according to any desired scheme (rfc4862, rfc7217, et cetera) is
   inherent in the setting of the X bit.

   Accordingly, the A bit MUST be interpreted as having been set if the
   host wishes to apply standard address generation schemes that require
   the bit to be set.

   Crucially, the PIO-X receiving node is NOT required to perform
   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) on any address it configures, nor
   is it required to configure the address on the link over which the
   PIO-X information was received (i.e. it is under no obligation to

Internet-Draft   Prefix Information Option Exclusive Bit     August 2016


   form addresses in a way that they meet the qualification of being on-
   link according to the definition in rfc5942#section-4, item 1).

4.2.  basics

   When the host receives an RA-X the host knows that it is alone and in
   full control of the prefix, the A (Autonomous) bit is implied to be
   set and the host can choose any valid addresses it wants within the
   subnet.

4.3.  Comparison with non-X-bit aware hosts

   Link-local address behaviour.  Changing your address might result in
   a loss of connectivity.  Respond to Neighbor Solications for link-
   local or risk connectivity troubles.

4.4.  Renewal

   Because the router(s) may not necessarily have lower layer hints
   about the disappearance of node that received a PIO with the X bit,
   hosts SHOULD re-RS at 1/2, 3/4, and 7/8 of preferred lifetime.

   Hosts compliant with this document SHOULD implement resilient-rs:
   https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7559

   Nodes SHOULD prefer sending traffic sourced from an exclusive prefix
   to the set of routers from which it received that prefix. (cite baker
   draft) Subject to default router lifetimes and RIO information, etc.

   It is possible for a node to receive multiple PIOs from multiple
   routers with a mix of exclusive and non-exclusive prefix information.

   The intent here is not to create sophisticated routing architectures
   can would be better handled by an actual routing protocol.  As such:

      A PIO-X receiving node SHOULD NOT generate ICMPv6 Redirects
      (reference) for any address within its exclusive prefix.
      Redirecting portions of exclusive prefixes to other on-link nodes
      is not a supported configuration.

      A PIO-X receiving node SHOULD NOT transmit RAs with any subset of
      its exclusive prefixes via the same interface through which the
      exlucive prefix was learned.

5.  Router behaviour

5.1.  foo

   When the host starts using the network connection it sends out an RS
   (Router Solicitation).  This is one way of detecting that a new
   device.  If the router is configured to use RA-X, it can now prepare
   itself to send the RA-X and then send it.

   The RA-X packet MUST be sent using the unicast L2 address (if
   applicable) and the L3 address of the host, learnt from the RS packet
   received from the host.

   (***HOW TO HANDLE WHEN FOR INSTANCE 802.1X OR WIFI-AP-ATTACHMENT IS
   USED TO DETECT A NEW HOST***)

   R1  L2 signals for loss of host

   R2  Consider not reassigning a prefix immediately given that some
       hosts might reappear, attempt DNAv6, and it may be desirable to
       re-PIO-X them with the same prefix.

5.2.  Preparations before sending RA-X

   When the router intends to send the RA-X, it MUST before sending the
   RA packet install an IPv6 forwarding entry, assuring the prefix works
   as soon as the host receives the RA-X and starts using it.

5.3.  Implementation considerations

   Out of scope things that are with careful consideration include:

   Routers SHOULD NOT announce the same prefix to two different nodes
   within the valid lifetime of the earlier of the two PIO
   announcements.

   A link may operate in a mode where routers announce RAs to all nodes,
   possibly with non-exclusive PIO data, and non-zero default router
   lifetimes.  Separately, one or more other nodes on the link may
   announce exclusive PIO information to nodes along with zero default
   router lifetimes.  "Host processing" rules require that the receiving
   node (or "host") send exclusive PIO originated traffic destined off-
   link through routers with non-zero default router lifetimes.

5.4.  Timers

   Routers SHOULD NOT announce the same prefix to two different nodes
   within the valid lifetime of the earlier of the two PIO
   announcements.

   It is a configuration error for more than one router on a link to
   announce PIO-X information for the same prefix with substantially
   different lifetimes.

   The router MUST send new unicast RAs according to the times defined
   in RFC XXX section XYZ.  It detects that the host is still available
   either by wiki AP attachment, link being up, or by verifying host
   availability by doing NUD.  Energy RFC reference, to balance out the
   number of transmissions required for the host to maintain
   connectivity given a certain percentage of packet loss with the
   resource impact on the host of receiving and processing an RA (e.g.
   if the receiving host has energy conservation objectives).

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo contains no requests of IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document fundamentally introduces no new protocol or behaviour
   substantively different from existing behaviour on a link which
   guarantees a unique /64 prefix to every attached host.  It only
   describes a mechanism to convey that topological reality, allowing
   the host to make certain optimizations as well as share the exclusive
   prefix as it sees fit with other nodes according to its capabilities
   and policies.
