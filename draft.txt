1.  Introduction

   This document defines a new control bit in the Internet Protocol
   version 6 (IPv6) Router Advertisement (RA) Prefix Information Option
   (PIO) flags octet that indicates that the node receiving this RA is
   the exclusive receiver of all traffic destined to any address with
   that prefix.  Subject to the lifetime constraints within the PIO, the
   receiving node is effectively the exclusive owner of this prefix and
   the sending router's next hop for all traffic destined to any address
   within this prefix.

   Termed the eXclusive bit (or "X bit"), nodes that recognize this can
   perform some traffic-saving optimizations (e.g. disable Neighbor
   Discovery (ND) and Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) for addresses
   within this prefix) and more easily make creative use of its address
   space (vis a vis 7934).

   RFC 4861 compliant nodes that do not understand the X bit are not
   negatively impacted--they can process the PIO under existing
   standards and make use of the information exactly as if the X bit
   were not set.

Internet-Draft   Prefix Information Option Exclusive Bit     August 2016


   It is possible for a node to receive multiple PIOs from multiple
   routers with a mix of exclusive and non-exclusive prefix information.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Summary

   There are several initiatives that propose network side practices
   that provides customer isolation and to enhance scalability, power
   efficiency, security and other factors in networks.  Some of these
   involve isolating a host so that the host is the only one in the L3
   subnet (prefix).

   (list drafts/RFCs here)

   This document proposes an additional bit in the IPv6 Prefix
   Information Option (PIO) that tells the host that it's the only host
   in this prefix, and that it thus doesn't need to perform ND
   (Neighbour Discovery) and DAD (Duplicate Address Detection)

   R2

2.1.3.  term c

   R3



2.1.4.  term d

   For backward compatibility, the A bit MUST be set.  A node that does
   not understand the X bit should still be able to form addresses as it
   would for any other SLAAC-capable link.  A node implementing this
   specification MUST ignore the A bit if the X bit is set; it makes no
   difference, since the X bit implies any packets destined to addresses
   in the specified prefix will be routed to the node.

3.  Host behaviour

3.1.  basics

   When the host receives an RA-X the host knows that it is alone and in
   full control of the prefix, the A (Autonomous) bit is implied to be
   set and the host can choose any valid addresses it wants within the
   subnet.

3.2.  Comparison with non-X-bit aware hosts

   Link-local address behaviour.  Changing your address might result in
   a loss of connectivity.  Respond to Neighbor Solications for link-
   local or risk connectivity troubles.

3.3.  Renewal

   Because the router(s) may not necessarily have lower layer hints
   about the disappearance of node that received a PIO with the X bit,
   hosts SHOULD re-RS at 1/2, 3/4, and 7/8 of preferred lifetime.

   Hosts compliant with this document SHOULD implement resilient-rs:
   https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7559

   Nodes SHOULD prefer sending traffic sourced from an exclusive prefix
   to the set of routers from which it received that prefix. (cite baker
   draft) Subject to default router lifetimes and RIO information, etc.

4.  Router behaviour

4.1.  foo

   When the host starts using the network connection it sends out an RS
   (Router Solicitation).  This is one way of detecting that a new
   device.  If the router is configured to use RA-X, it can now prepare
   itself to send the RA-X and then send it.

   The RA-X packet MUST be sent using the unicast L2 address (if
   applicable) and the L3 address of the host, learnt from the RS packet
   received from the host.

   (***HOW TO HANDLE WHEN FOR INSTANCE 802.1X OR WIFI-AP-ATTACHMENT IS
   USED TO DETECT A NEW HOST***)

   R4  L2 signals for loss of host

   R5  Consider not reassigning a prefix immediately given that some
       hosts might reappear, attempt DNAv6, and it may be desirable to
       re-PIO-X them with the same prefix.

4.2.  Preparations before sending RA-X

   When the router intends to send the RA-X, it MUST before sending the
   RA packet install an IPv6 forwarding entry, assuring the prefix works
   as soon as the host receives the RA-X and starts using it.

4.3.  Implementation considerations

   Out of scope things that are with careful consideration include:

   Routers SHOULD NOT announce the same prefix to two different nodes
   within the valid lifetime of the earlier of the two PIO
   announcements.

   A link may operate in a mode where routers announce RAs to all nodes,
   possibly with non-exclusive PIO data, and non-zero default router
   lifetimes.  Separately, one or more other nodes on the link may
   announce exclusive PIO information to nodes along with zero default
   router lifetimes.  "Host processing" rules require that the receiving
   node (or "host") send exclusive PIO originated traffic destined off-
   link through routers with non-zero default router lifetimes.

4.4.  Timers

   Routers SHOULD NOT announce the same prefix to two different nodes
   within the valid lifetime of the earlier of the two PIO
   announcements.

   It is a configuration error for more than one router on a link to
   announce PIO-X information for the same prefix with substantially
   different lifetimes.

   The router MUST send new unicast RAs according to the times defined
   in RFC XXX section XYZ.  It detects that the host is still available
   either by wiki AP attachment, link being up, or by verifying host
   availability by doing NUD.  Energy RFC reference, to balance out the
   number of transmissions required for the host to maintain
   connectivity given a certain percentage of packet loss with the
   resource impact on the host of receiving and processing an RA (e.g.
   if the receiving host has energy conservation objectives).
