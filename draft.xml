    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
This document defines a new control bit in the Internet Protocol version 6
(IPv6) Router Advertisement (RA) Prefix Information Option (PIO) flags octet
that indicates that the node receiving this RA is the exclusive receiver of
all traffic destined to any address with that prefix. Subject to the lifetime
constraints within the PIO, the receiving node effectively has exclusive
use of the prefix, and will be the next hop destination for the sending router,
and possibly other routers, for all traffic destined toward the prefix.
      </t>
      <t>
Termed the eXclusive bit (or "X bit"), nodes that recognize this can perform
some traffic-saving optimizations (e.g. disable Neighbor Discovery (ND) and
Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) for addresses within this prefix) and more
easily make creative use of its address space (vis a vis 7934).
      </t>
      <t>
Use of the X bit is backward compatible with existing compliant
implementations. RFC 4861 compliant nodes that do not understand the X bit
are not negatively impacted.  They must ignore it, and can process the PIO
under existing standards, making use of the information exactly as if the
X bit were not set.

    <section anchor="motivation" title="Motivation">
      <t>
There are several initiatives that propose network side practices that provide
customer isolation and to enhance scalability, power efficiency, security and
other factors in networks. Some of these involve isolating a host so that the
host is the only one in the L3 subnet (prefix).

      <t>
This document proposes an additional bit in the IPv6 Prefix Information Option
(PIO) that tells the host that it's the only host in this prefix, and that it
thus doesn't need to perform ND (Neighbour Discovery) and DAD
(Duplicate Address Detection)

  <section title="Terminology">
    <section title="Abbreviations">
        <t>
Throughout this document the following terminology is used purely for the
sake of brevity.
        </t>

        <section title="PIO-X">
          <t>
The term "PIO-X" is used to refer to a Prefix Information Option (PIO)
that has the X bit set.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title="PIO-X RA">
          <t>
The phrase "PIO-X RA" is used to refer to an RA that contains one or more
PIO-X entries (the same RA may also contain one or more PIOs without the
X bit set).
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Host">
          <t>
The term "host" may be used interchangably throughout this document to mean
a node receiving an RA. No behaviour restrictions traditionally associated
with distinctions between host and router are placed on nodes receiving any
PIO-X RA.

<t>
Nodes compliant with this specification, i.e. those that understand the X-bit,
MUST (if the X-bit is set) ignore the actual values of the L and A bits and
instead intepret them as follows:
</t>

<t>
<list style="symbols">
  <t>interpret the L bit as if it were 0 (L=0)</t>
  <t>interpret the A bit as it it were 1 (A=1)</t>
</list>
The rationale for this is discussed further in <xref target="host_behaviour"/>.
</t>

<t>
If the node receives PIO-X RA over a link-layer medium that supports
unicast/multicast/broadcast link-layer addresses, it SHOULD verify that the
PIO-X RA destination L3 address is its own link-local L3 address.  If this
L3 link-local address verification fails, the node SHOULD ignore the PIO-X bit
and continue processing as if X=0. If the node receives PIO-X RA over a
point-to-point medium (such as PPP) it SHOULD ignore this verification and
process the PIO-X normally.
</t>

<t>
It is RECOMMENDED that RAs containing a PIO with the X-bit set also explicitly
configure the PIO flags L=0 and A=1, for backward compatibility
(use by non X-bit aware nodes).

    </section>

    <section anchor="host_behaviour" title="Host behaviour">
      <section title="PIO-X processing">
        <t>
A receiving node compliant with this document processes a PIO entry with
the X bit set following the requirements in previous standards documents
(chiefly rfc4861#section-6.3.4) with one key difference: the actual values
of the L bit and the A bit are ignored. Instead, the receiving node MUST
interpret the L and A bits according to <xref target="pio-x_processing"/>.
        </t>

        <section title="PIO L bit">
          <t>
Because a PIO-X aware node will know that it has exclusive use of a prefix
with non-zero valid lifetime, the prefix itself cannot be considered to be
on-link with respect to the link on which the PIO-X RA was received.
          </t>
          <t>
Note that a given address from within the prefix may be considered on-link
according to the definition in rfc5942#section-4, item 1, should the
receiving node chose to configure that address on said link, but this is in
no way synonymous with the entire prefix being considered on-link.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title="PIO A bit">
          <t>
Because a PIO-X aware node will know that it has exclusive use of a prefix
with non-zero valid lifetime, autoconfiguration of addresses according to
any desired scheme (rfc4862, rfc7217, et cetera) is inherent in the setting
of the X bit.
          </t>
          <t>
Accordingly, the A bit can be interpreted as having been set, should the host
choose to apply standard address generation schemes that require the bit to
be set. It is free to assign any address formed from an exclusive prefix to any
available interface; it is not required to configure the address on the link
over which the PIO-X RA was received (i.e. it is under no obligation to form
addresses such that they would be classified as on-link (according to the
definition in rfc5942#section-4, item 1).

        <section title="Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)">
          <t>
Whatever use the host makes of the exclusive prefix during its valid lifetime,
it SHOULD NOT perform Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) on any address it
configures from within the prefix if that address is configured on either the
interface over which the PIO-X RA was received or on a loopback interface.
Note that this does not absolve the host from performing DAD in all scenarios;
if, for example, the host uses the prefix for 64sharing it MUST at a minimum
defend via DAD any addresses it has configured for itself as documented in
Requirement 2 of RFC7278 section 3.

        <section title="Router Solications (RSes)">
          <t>
Routers announcing PIO-X RAs may record the link-local address of an RS as
the next hop for the exclusive prefix. As such, hosts compliant with this
specification SHOULD issue Router Solications from a link-local address; they
SHOULD NOT use the unspecified address (::) when sending RSes.
          </t>

          <t>
It is possible for a node to receive multiple RAs with a mix of exclusive and
non-exclusive PIOs and even non-zero and zero default router lifetimes. While
it is not possible for a host (receiving node) to be sure it has received all
the RA information available to it, hosts compliant with this specification
SHOULD implement Packet-Loss Resiliency for Router Solicitations
<xref target="RFC7559"/> so that the host continues to transmit Router
Solicitations at least until an RA with a non-zero default router lifetime
has been seen.

      </section>

      <section title="Link-local address behaviour">
        <t>
Routers announcing PIO-X RAs may record the link-local address of an RS as
the next hop for the exclusive prefix. The host MUST continue to respond to
Neighbor Solicitations for this address. Hosts that attempt to change their
link-local address may experience a loss of connectivity.

The receiving node SHOULD perform source address selection and next hop router

designated as exclusive use for the host.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Additional guidance">
        <t>
The intent of networks that use PIO-X RAs is not to enable sophisticated
routing architectures that could be far better handled by an actual routing
protocol but rather to propagate a prefix's exclusive use information to
enable the receiving node to make better use of the available addresses.
As such:
          <list>
            <t>
A PIO-X receiving node SHOULD NOT issue ICMPv6 Redirects
(<xref target="RFC4861"/> section 4.5) for any address within its exclusive
prefix via the link over which the PIO-X RA was received. Redirecting portions
of exclusive prefixes to other "upstream" on-link nodes is not a supported
configuration.
            </t>
            <t>
A PIO-X receiving node SHOULD NOT transmit RAs with any subset of its exclusive
prefixes via the same interface through which the exclusive prefix was learned.
            </t>
            <t>
The processing of timers and other behaviour regarding the PIO is unchanged to
what is specified in other IPv6 standardization documents.

XXX This section needs a lot of work.
      </t>

      <section title="PIO-X RA destination address">
        <t>
Since the host will not perform DAD for addresses within prefix announced via
PIO-X, it's very important that only a single host receives the PIO-X RA.
Therefore, the router SHOULD only include PIO-X in RAs that are sent
using unicast RAs to destination unicast link-layer address and IPv6 link-local
unicast address for a specific host. For point-to-point media
without link-layer addresses and where there is only single host that will
receive the PIO-X RA, the router MAY send PIO-X RA with multicast destination
IPv6 address and keep track of binding table per point-to-point interface.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Detecting hosts to send PIO-X RAs to">
        <t>
When the host starts using a network connection it normally sends out an RS
(Router Solicitation) packet. This is one way for the router to detect that
a new host is connected to the network and detects its link-local address. If
the router is configured to use PIO-X, it can now perform necessary
processing/configuration and then send the PIO-X RA.
        </t>
        <t>
For some networks, the host information regarding link-layer and link-local
address might be available through other mechanism(s).  Examples of this are
PPP, 802.1x and 3GPP mobile networks. In that case this information MAY be
used instead of relying on the host to send RS. It is however RECOMMENDED
that these networks also provide indication whether the host is no longer
connected to the network so that the router can invalidate the prefix binding.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Binding table requirements">
        <t>
          <list counter="reqs" hangIndent="4" style="format R%d">
            <t>
The router SHOULD keep track of what PIO-X prefix has been assigned to each node.
            </t>
            <t>
The router SHOULD keep the binding between prefix and link-local address for
2x the advertised lifetime of the prefix.
            </t>
            <t>
The binding SHOULD be considered refreshed each time the router receives an RS
from a link-local address and the router sends out corresponding PIO-X RA.
This means a prefix isn't re-used for another node for 2x the lifetime of the
prefix advertised to the first node.
            </t>
            <t>
If the router is informed by some other mechanism (link-layer indication for
instance) that a node is no longer connected to the link, it MAY immediately
invalidate the prefix binding.
(DISCUSS: is this the correct approach? Do we want to point to some definition somewhere else?)
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Preparations before sending RA-X">
        <t>
When the router intends to send PIO-X RA, it SHOULD before sending the PIO-X RA,
complete all necessary processing needed for the host to start using the PIO-X
prefix to communicate through the router to other networks. This is so that the
host can start using PIO-X immediately upon reception of the PIO-X RA.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Implementation considerations">
        <t>
Out of scope things that are with careful consideration include: XXX
        </t>
        <t>
Routers SHOULD NOT announce the same prefix to two different nodes within
the valid lifetime of the earlier of the two PIO announcements.
        </t>
        <t>
A link may operate in a mode where routers announce RAs to all nodes,
possibly with non-exclusive PIO data, and non-zero default router lifetimes.
Separately, one or more other nodes on the link may announce exclusive PIO
information to nodes along with zero default router lifetimes.
"Host processing" rules require that the receiving node (or "host")
send exclusive PIO originated traffic destined off-link through routers with
non-zero default router lifetimes.

Routers SHOULD NOT announce the same prefix to two different nodes within
the valid lifetime of the earlier of the two PIO announcements.
        </t>
        <t>
It is a configuration error for more than one router on a link to announce
PIO-X information for the same prefix with substantially different lifetimes.
        </t>
        <t>
The router MUST send new unicast RAs according to the times defined in RFC XXX
section XYZ. It detects that the host is still available either by wiki AP
attachment, link being up, or by verifying host availability by doing NUD
to the host link-local address.

Energy RFC reference, to balance out the number of transmissions required for
the host to maintain connectivity given a certain percentage of packet loss
with the resource impact on the host of receiving and processing an RA (e.g.
if the receiving host has energy conservation objectives).

This document fundamentally introduces no new protocol or behaviour
substantively different from existing behaviour on a link which guarantees
a unique /64 prefix to every attached host. It only describes a mechanism
to convey that topological reality, allowing the host to make certain
optimizations as well as share the exclusive prefix as it sees fit with
other nodes according to its capabilities and policies.

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
