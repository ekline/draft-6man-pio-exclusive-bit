NOTES:

    - rewrite processing to be more programmatic in its processing
        - exception conditional exits up front
          (like exceptions for point-to-point links)
    - consider defining some more helpful terms
        - known guaranteed point-to-point link
    - section about "likely sole recipient" that can be referred to
      from other sections

    - Clarify benefits in terms of time saved not doing DAD and
      infrastructure-friendly operations.
        - a node could try to use 2^64 optimistic addresses, but
          that's not very friendly unless it knows it's safe

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
This document defines a new control bit in the Internet Protocol version 6
(IPv6) Router Advertisement (RA) Prefix Information Option (PIO) flags octet
that indicates that the node receiving this RA is the exclusive receiver of
all traffic destined to any address with that prefix. Subject to the lifetime
constraints within the PIO, the receiving node effectively has exclusive
use of the prefix, and will be the next hop destination for the sending router,
and possibly other routers, for all traffic destined toward the prefix.
      </t>
      <t>
Termed the eXclusive bit (or "X bit"), nodes that recognize this can perform
some traffic-saving optimizations (e.g. disable Neighbor Discovery (ND) and
Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) for addresses within this prefix) and more
immediately pursue the benefits of being provided multiple addresses
(vis. <xref target="RFC7934"/> section 3).
      </t>
      <t>
Additionally, network infrastructure nodes (routers, switches) can benefit by
minimizing the number of {link layer, IP} address pairs required to offer
network connectivity (vis. <xref target="RFC7934"/> section 9.3). A router,
for example, need not create any {link layer, IP} address pair entries for
IP address within a proffered exclusive-use prefix--it can reliably forward
all traffic to the network node to which it advertised the prefix. This solves
a potential link layer state exhaustion problem, i.e excessive number of
{link layer, IP address pairs}, using IP layer forwarding.
      </t>
      <t>
Use of the X bit is backward compatible with existing IPv6 standards compliant
implementations. <xref target="RFC4861"/>-compliant nodes that do not
understand the X bit are not negatively impacted.  They must ignore it, and
can process the PIO under existing standards, making use of the information
exactly as if the X bit were not set.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="motivation" title="Motivation">
      <t>
There are several initiatives that propose network side practices that provide
customer isolation, enhanced operational scalability, power efficiency, security
and other benefits in IPv6 network deployments. Some of these involve isolating
a host (or RA accepting client node) so that the host is the only node to
receive a specific prefix, including
<list style="symbols">
  <t>
DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation to hosts
(<eref target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-templin-v6ops-pdhost"/>), and
  </t>
  <t>
advertising a unique prefix per host via unique RAs.
(<eref target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-v6ops-unique-ipv6-prefix-per-host"/>).
  </t>
</list>
      </t>

      <t>
Some architectures further isolate the host layers below IPv6, for improved
client node security.  Regardless of the specific level of isolation, the host
can best make optimizations and choices about its use of a prefix exclusively
forwarded to itself if the host can be informed of the exclusivity.  In the
case of a DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation the prefix can be assumed to be of exclusive
use by the requesting node (in accordance with the model in
<xref target="RFC3633"/>).
      </t>
      <t>
This memo documents an additional bit in the IPv6 RA PIO that makes this
information explicit to receiving node.

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

    <section title="Abbreviations">
        <t>
Throughout this document the following terminology is used purely for the
sake of brevity.
        </t>

        <section title="PIO-X">
          <t>
The term "PIO-X" is used to refer to a Prefix Information Option (PIO)
that has the X bit set.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title="PIO-X RA">
          <t>
The phrase "PIO-X RA" is used to refer to an IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA)
that contains one or more PIO-X entries (the same RA may also contain one or
more PIOs without the X bit set).
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Host">
          <t>
The term "host" may be used interchangeably throughout this document to mean
a network node receiving and processing an RA. The receiving node may itself
be a router, or may temporarily become one by routing all or a portion of an
exclusive use prefix.
          </t>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Updated Prefix Information Option">
      <t>
This document updates the Prefix Information Option specification in
RFC 4861, section 4.6.2 with the definition of a bit from the former Reserved1
field as follows.

<t>
Nodes compliant with this specification perform the following additional
processing of RAs and PIO-X options when a PIO-X option is present.
</t>

        <section anchor="pio-x_sole_recipient"
                 title="Verify sole recipient">
<t>
A node receiving a PIO-X option MUST verify that it is the (likely) sole
intended recipient of the PIO-X RA.  This done by verifying that the RA is
unicast to the node at the IPv6 layer and, if applicable, at the link layer.
On links that provide the node with a guarantee that it is the only possible
PIO-X RA recipient (e.g.  PPP, 3GPP links) this validation step SHOULD NOT
be performed.
</t>

<t>
If an address other than :: (the unspecified address) was used as the source
address for one or more Router Solicitations (RS) on this link, the node MUST
verify that the IPv6 destination address of the PIO-X RA is one of the RS
source addresses in use.  If the link over which this communication takes
place is known to be point-to-point, i.e. the nature of the link ensures that
the node is the only possible recipient of an RA this check SHOULD NOT be
performed.
</t>

<t>
If the node receives a PIO-X RA over a link-layer medium that supports
link-layer addresses, it MUST verify that the link-layer destination address
of the PIO-X RA is its own link-layer address.  If the node received a PIO-X RA
over a point-to-point medium (such as PPP) this step is unnecessary.
</t>

<t>
If any part of this "sole unicast recipient" verification fails, the node MUST
ignore the PIO-X bit and continue processing as if it were not set (X=0).
</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="pio-x_other_flags"
                 title="(Re)Interpretation of other flags">
<t>
Nodes compliant with this specification, i.e. those that understand the X-bit,
MUST, when the X-bit is set, ignore the actual values of the L and A flags
and instead interpret them as follows:
</t>

<t>
<list style="symbols">
  <t>interpret the L bit as if it were 0 (L=0)</t>
  <t>interpret the A bit as it it were 1 (A=1)</t>
</list>
The rationale for this is as follows.
</t>
            <section title="PIO L bit">
              <t>
Because a PIO-X aware node will know that it has exclusive use of a prefix
with non-zero valid lifetime, the prefix itself cannot be considered to be
on-link with respect to the link on which the PIO-X RA was received.
              </t>
              <t>
Note that a given address from within the prefix may be considered on-link
according to the definition in <eref target="RFC5942"/> section 4, item 1,
should the receiving node chose to configure that address on said link, but
this is in no way synonymous with the entire prefix being considered on-link.
              </t>
            </section>

            <section title="PIO A bit">
              <t>
Because a PIO-X aware node will know that it has exclusive use of a prefix
with non-zero valid lifetime, autoconfiguration of addresses according to
any desired scheme, e.g. <eref target="RFC4862"/>, <eref target="RFC7217"/>,
et cetera, is implicit in the setting of the X bit.
              </t>
              <t>
Accordingly, the A bit can be interpreted as having been set, should the host
choose to apply standard address generation schemes that require the bit to
be set. It is free to assign any address formed from an exclusive prefix to any
available interface; it is not required to configure the address on the link
over which the PIO-X RA was received (i.e. it is under no obligation to form
addresses such that they would be classified as on-link (according to the
definition in <eref target="RFC5942"/> section 4, item 1).

      </section>

      <section anchor="pio-x_transmission" title="Transmitting PIO-X RAs">
<t>
When a router transmits an RA containing one or more PIO-X options it MUST
unicast the PIO-X RA to its intended recipient at the IPv6 layer and, if
applicable, at the link-layer.
</t>
<t>
It is RECOMMENDED that a PIO with the X-bit set also have the PIO flags
L=0 and A=1 explicitly configured, for backward compatibility (i.e. use
by non X-bit aware nodes).

        <t>
A receiving node compliant with this document processes an RA with a PIO
entry with the X flag set according the requirements in previous standards
documents (chiefly <eref target="RFC4861"/> section 6.3.4) subject to the
additional requirements documented in <xref target="pio-x_processing"/>.

      </section>

      <section title="Neighbor Discovery implications">
        <section title="Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)">
          <t>
Whatever use the host makes of the exclusive prefix during its valid lifetime,
it SHOULD NOT perform Duplicate Address Detection ("DAD",
<eref target="RFC4862"/> section 5.4) on any address it
configures from within the prefix if that address is configured on either the
interface over which the PIO-X RA was received or on a loopback interface.
Note that this does not absolve the host from performing DAD in all scenarios;
if, for example, the host uses the prefix for
<eref target="RFC7278">64sharing</eref> it MUST at a minimum defend via DAD
any addresses it has configured for itself as documented in Requirement 2 of
<eref target="RFC7278"/> section 3.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Router Solicitations (RSes)">
          <t>
Routers announcing PIO-X RAs do so via IPv6 unicast to the intended receiving
node and may note the IPv6 unicast destination address of an RS as the next
hop for the exclusive prefix. As such, hosts compliant with this SHOULD NOT
use the unspecified address (::) when sending RSes; they SHOULD prefer
issuing Router Solicitations from a link-local address.
          </t>

          <t>
It is possible for a node to receive multiple RAs with a mix of exclusive and
non-exclusive PIOs and even non-zero and zero default router lifetimes. While
it is not possible for a host (receiving node) to be sure it has received all
the RA information available to it, hosts compliant with this specification
SHOULD implement Packet-Loss Resiliency for Router Solicitations
<xref target="RFC7559"/> so that the host continues to transmit Router
Solicitations at least until an RA with a non-zero default router lifetime
has been seen.
          </t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Link-local address behaviour">
        <t>
Routers announcing PIO-X RAs may record the source (link-local) address of an
RS as the next hop for the exclusive prefix. A node compliant with this
specification MUST continue to respond to Neighbor Solicitations for the source
address used to send RSes (alternatively: the destination address of unicast
PIO-X RAs received). Hosts that deprecate or even remove this address may
experience a loss of connectivity.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Source address selection">
        <t>
No change to existing source address selection behaviour is required or

      <section title="Additional guidance">
        <t>
The intent of networks that use PIO-X RAs is not to enable sophisticated
routing architectures that could be far better handled by an actual routing
protocol but rather to propagate a prefix's exclusive use information to

A PIO-X receiving node SHOULD NOT issue ICMPv6 Redirects
(<xref target="RFC4861"/> section 4.5) for any address within an exclusive use
prefix via the link over which the PIO-X RA was received. Redirecting portions
of exclusive prefixes to other "upstream" on-link nodes is not a supported
configuration.
            </t>
            <t>
A PIO-X receiving node SHOULD NOT transmit RAs with any subset of its exclusive
prefixes via the same interface through which the exclusive prefix was learned.

      <section title="PIO-X RA destination address">
        <t>
Since the host will not perform DAD for addresses within prefix announced via
PIO-X, it's very important that only a single host receives the PIO-X RA.
Therefore, the router MUST only include PIO-X in RAs that are sent
using unicast RAs to destination unicast link-layer address and IPv6 link-local
unicast address for a specific host. For point-to-point media
without link-layer addresses or where there is guaranteed to only be single
host that will receive the PIO-X RA (e.g. as enforced by link layer mechanisms),
the router MAY send PIO-X RA with multicast destination IPv6 address. Under all
circumstances the router MUST maintain a binding table of state information as
discussed in <xref target="piox_binding_table"/>.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Detecting hosts to send PIO-X RAs to">
        <t>
When the host starts using a network connection it normally sends out an RS
(Router Solicitation) packet. This is one way for the router to detect that
a new host is connected to the network and detects its link-local address. If
the router is configured to use PIO-X, it can now perform necessary
processing/configuration and then send the PIO-X RA.
        </t>
        <t>
For some networks, the host information regarding link-layer and link-local
address might be available through other mechanism(s).  Examples of this are
PPP, 802.1x and 3GPP mobile networks. In that case this information MAY be
used instead of relying on the host to send RS. It is however RECOMMENDED
that these networks also provide indication whether the host is no longer
connected to the network so that the router can invalidate the prefix binding
prior to binding expiration (timeout).

The router SHOULD keep track of which PIO-X prefix has been issued to each
node.
            </t>
            <t>
The router SHOULD keep the binding between prefix and link-local address for
the advertised valid lifetime, plus some operationally determined delay prior
to reissuing a prefix ("grace period"), of the prefix.
            </t>
            <t>
The router MUST monitor the reachability of each node in the binding table via
Neighbor Unreachability Detection ("NUD", <eref target="RFC4861"/> section 7.3)
or an equivalent link-layer mechanism.
            </t>
            <t>
The binding SHOULD be considered refreshed every time a periodic PIO-X RA is
sent to a node.
            </t>
            <t>
If the router is informed by some other mechanism (link-layer indication for
instance) that a node is no longer connected to the link, it MAY immediately
invalidate the prefix binding.
(DISCUSS:
    Is this the correct approach?
    Do we want to point to some definition somewhere else?)

      <section title="Preparations before sending a PIO-X RA">
        <t>
When the router intends to send a PIO-X RA, it SHOULD before sending the PIO-X RA,
complete all necessary processing needed for the host to start using the PIO-X
prefix to communicate through the router to other networks. This is so that the
host can start using PIO-X based addresses immediately after reception of the PIO-X RA.

      <section title="Implementation considerations">
        <t>
TODO: Out of scope things that are worth careful consideration include...
        </t>
        <t>
Routers SHOULD NOT announce the same prefix to two different nodes within
the valid lifetime of the earlier of the two PIO-X announcements.
        </t>
        <t>
A link may operate in a mode where routers announce RAs to all nodes,
possibly with non-exclusive PIO data, and non-zero default router lifetimes.
Separately, one or more other nodes on the link may announce exclusive PIO
information to nodes along with zero default router lifetimes.
Except in the presence of a non-expired more specific route, e.g. learning from
an <eref target="RFC4191"/> Route Information Option (RIO), the receiving
node should send exclusive use prefix originated or forwarded traffic destined
off-link through routers with non-zero default router lifetimes.

This document fundamentally introduces no new protocol or behaviour
substantively different from existing behaviour on a link which guarantees
a unique /64 prefix to every attached host. It only describes a mechanism
to convey that topological reality, allowing the host to make certain
optimizations as well as share the exclusive prefix as it sees fit with
other nodes according to its capabilities and policies.
